Akai Amp Project
================

An Akai AM75 Amp has had its volume control changed to use
a motor controlled potentiometer. This project uses hardware
controlled by a Rapsberry Pi 3B+ and a relay card to control
the volume potentiometer and also to switch the mains for
the amplifier.

The software runs on a Rasperry Pi 3B+ that has had HiFiBerryOS
installed:

Relay card details

This boards uses the CH340 UART to USB chip, which needs a driver
(https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers/all).
The driver seems to be installed on HiFiBerryOS, but the card was not
recognised when plugged in before trying:

        sudo depmod -a
        
As described in the driver installation manual:

The default baud rate is 9600 bps.
